# Top of the Morning

Read the news and get the weather in bed. A toy project to learn Angular.

## Setup

To configure environment variables used throughout the application, I use
[dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv). Create a `.env` file, add it and
add any necessary keys:
```
OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```
